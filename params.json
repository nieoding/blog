Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\r\n\r\nTo add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\r\n\r\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\r\n\r\n{% highlight ruby %}\r\ndef print_hi(name)\r\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\r\nend\r\nprint_hi('Tom')\r\n#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\r\n{% endhighlight %}\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].\r\n\r\n[jekyll-docs]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home\r\n[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\r\n[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/\r\n",
